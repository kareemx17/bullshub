## Features

This project offers a variety of features designed to enhance the connectivity and interaction among users within a geographically defined area. Below are the key functionalities:

- **Proximity-Based User Matching**: Utilizes the Google Maps API to fetch and manage user locations. The platform leverages a Quick Sort Algorithm to efficiently sort users based on their proximity, enabling the system to match students who are closest to each other. This feature is particularly useful for creating localized user experiences and fostering community interactions.

- **Real-Time Messaging**: Integrates a robust real-time messaging feature using Socket.io, which allows users to communicate instantaneously within the platform. This feature is supported by a PostgreSQL database backend that maintains message integrity and history securely.

- **Enhanced Security with JSON Web Tokens (JWT)**: Ensures secure communication and data exchange across the platform. The implementation of JWT provides a mechanism for authenticating requests and protecting against common security threats, ensuring that all messages and user interactions are securely managed.

- **Authentication Using OAuth**: Implements OAuth authentication to facilitate secure and straightforward user logins. This feature allows users to authenticate using existing credentials from external providers (e.g., Google, Facebook), simplifying the login process while maintaining high security and privacy standards.

These features are designed to provide a seamless and secure user experience, promoting effective communication and interaction among students within the same locality.

## Tech Stack

This project leverages a combination of powerful technologies organized into frontend, backend, and auxiliary services. Here's how the technologies are applied across the different layers of the application:

### Frontend
- **React**: Utilized for building dynamic user interfaces and managing state across the application.
- **React Router**: Handles the routing within the React application, allowing for seamless navigation between components without full page reloads.

### Backend
- **FastAPI**: Serves as the backend framework, providing high performance and easy-to-handle API routes with Python. It is responsible for all server-side logic including database operations and API response handling.
- **PostgreSQL**: The primary relational database used for storing all application data including user profiles, message history, and authentication data.
- **Socket.io**: Enables real-time bi-directional communication between the server and the client, crucial for the messaging feature.

### Security
- **OAuth**: Manages authentication processes, enabling users to sign in using their existing accounts from major providers, thereby ensuring secure and convenient user authentication.

### Integrations
- **Google Maps API**: Integrated for handling geolocation functionalities, crucial for the proximity-based user matching feature.

Each component of the tech stack has been chosen not only for its performance but also for its ability to work cohesively with other technologies, ensuring a robust, scalable, and maintainable application architecture.
